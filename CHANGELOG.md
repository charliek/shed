# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v0.1.1

- Include custom Firecracker kernel in published images — users no longer need to compile a kernel or run `build-firecracker-kernel.sh` when using published images
- Add `GetNeedsInitrd()` to ImageConfig interface to make initrd extraction optional (VZ only)
- Update `extractKernel()` to handle both VZ-style compressed and FC-style uncompressed kernels
- Default Firecracker `kernel_path` to `{images_dir}/vmlinux` (auto-populated from published images)
- Defer Firecracker `kernel_path` validation when Docker refs are configured
- Extract `hasAnyDockerRef()` and `dockerRunScript()` shared helpers
- Update Firecracker setup docs and example configs for kernel-in-image workflow

## v0.1.0

### Features

- Add VZ backend for macOS Apple Silicon using vfkit/Virtualization.framework

- Add image extensibility with Docker ref support and multiple image variants
- Add image delete and prune commands for managing cached rootfs images
- Add Firecracker image management parity with VZ backend
- Add plugin message bus for extensible VM-host communication
- Add CI workflow to publish VZ and Firecracker base images to ghcr.io on release tags
- Add SSE progress streaming for shed create
- Add enriched shed metadata and tiered CLI verbosity

### Firecracker Backend

- Add 9P filesystem and UID remapping for local-dir mounts
- Add exclude patterns to credential mounts
- Add credential change notifications over persistent vsock channel

### VZ Backend

- Switch to VirtioFS for credential mounts
- Add Docker CE networking in guest VMs

- Provisioning and file sync for containers and VMs
- SSH tunnel management for port forwarding
- Tmux session management for persistent CLI sessions
- Credential mounts for CLI tools (Git, SSH, AWS, etc.)
- Bidirectional credential sync for Firecracker VMs
- Graceful shutdown hooks for Firecracker VMs
- JSON output flag for machine-readable CLI output
- Repo URL validation with shorthand expansion (e.g., `owner/repo`)
- Configurable timeouts for create and start operations
- MkDocs-based documentation

### Firecracker Backend

- Run VM commands as non-root shed user
- Kernel build scripts and Firecracker v1.14.1 support
