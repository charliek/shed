# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v0.3.4

- **Firecracker:** Fix PS1 prompt showing time instead of shed name (Dockerfile heredoc with single-quoted PS1, matching VZ)
- **Firecracker:** Fix credential mounts (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, `~/.config/gh`) appearing as `root:root` inside the VM — `resolvePathOwner` now falls back to UID 1000 (shed user) for root-owned host dirs instead of triggering p9 passthrough
- **Firecracker:** Implement missing 9P ops (`UnlinkAt`, `SetAttr` chmod, `SetAttr` timestamps) on `remappingFile`; p9 library's localfs returned ENOSYS for these
- **Firecracker (security):** Skip `chmod`/`chtimes` on symlinks in 9P `SetAttr` — `os.Chmod` and `os.Chtimes` follow symlinks, which could let a guest modify files outside the shared directory by crafting a symlink (matches the existing `os.Lchown` bypass for ownership changes)
- **Firecracker / VZ:** Add `bubblewrap` to both Dockerfiles (required by Codex CLI sandbox); remove obsolete `// +build` tags
- **Tests:** Stabilize `TestHandleConnectSuccess` CI flake — replace `net.Pipe` mock with real TCP socketpair so `BidirectionalCopy`'s `CloseWrite`-based EOF propagation works correctly, add I/O deadlines, exercise both copy directions (#74, #75)

## v0.3.3

- **Breaking (deb only):** Rename deb package `shed` → `shed-server` and the release artifact to `shed-server_<version>_<arch>.deb` to avoid silent collisions with Ubuntu's `shed` hex editor. Add `Conflicts: shed` so the two packages can never coexist. Hosts on the old v0.3.2 deb need to `sudo apt purge shed && sudo dpkg -i shed-server_0.3.3_*.deb` (the old binary at `/usr/local/bin/shed-server` may have been silently removed by an `apt upgrade` — `readlink /proc/$(pidof shed-server)/exe` showing `(deleted)` confirms this)
- Document the deb as the primary Linux install path (#71)
- Align `configs/server.local.yaml` (localfc) with localmac defaults (extensions, mounts, images)

## v0.3.2

- Add `.deb` package support via GoReleaser nfpm for Linux (Ubuntu/Pop!OS) deployment
- Add `shed-server setup` command for automated Firecracker infrastructure provisioning (Linux-only)
- Add `shed-server pull-images` command to pre-cache VM images from Docker refs (cross-platform)
- Add Homebrew tap automation via GoReleaser
- Add VZ entitlement codesigning in Homebrew post_install
- Improve Homebrew config with platform-specific defaults and extensions guidance
- Update docs for Homebrew install workflow

## v0.3.1

- Add Docker credential helper to experimental images (docker-credential-shed, guest Docker config)
- Enable `docker-credentials` namespace in local dev server config
- Bump shed-extensions to v0.3.1
- Add DialService, Connect API, and vsock TCP proxy (#62)
- Run initial extension health check immediately (#61)

## v0.2.0

- Replace `typescript` image variant with `experimental` (default + shed-extensions credential brokering)
- Publish `shed-vz-experimental` and `shed-fc-experimental` images to ghcr.io
- Add `--shed-ext-version` flag to build scripts for local development
- Add SFTP support and `environment.d` loading in shed-agent
- Consolidate health checks onto message bus with heartbeats
- Upgrade GitHub Actions to Node.js 24 compatible versions
- Fix hardcoded image versions in docs, reorient Quick Start

## v0.1.2

- Fix kernel extraction failing on Firecracker images due to `set -euo pipefail` aborting on glob mismatch before reaching the `/boot/vmlinux` fallback path

## v0.1.1

- Include custom Firecracker kernel in published images — users no longer need to compile a kernel or run `build-firecracker-kernel.sh` when using published images
- Add `GetNeedsInitrd()` to ImageConfig interface to make initrd extraction optional (VZ only)
- Update `extractKernel()` to handle both VZ-style compressed and FC-style uncompressed kernels
- Default Firecracker `kernel_path` to `{images_dir}/vmlinux` (auto-populated from published images)
- Defer Firecracker `kernel_path` validation when Docker refs are configured
- Extract `hasAnyDockerRef()` and `dockerRunScript()` shared helpers
- Update Firecracker setup docs and example configs for kernel-in-image workflow
