# shed integration test suite (`tests/integration/`)

Live integration tests that drive a running `shed-server` via the `shed`
CLI. Complements the pure file-parsing Go tests under `internal/`
(`make test`), which catch unit-file ordering regressions in CI; this
suite catches **live** create-cycle regressions that need a real VM.

Architecture: pytest + subprocess (+ Fabric later, only when needed for
remote-orchestration tasks). Managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
Background and decision rationale: see
`docs/discovery/platform-runtime-optimization.md` §16.

## Running

```sh
make test-integration
```

That target:

1. Verifies `uv` is installed (install via `brew install uv` or
   https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
2. `uv sync` the Python deps into `tests/integration/.venv` (gitignored).
3. `uv run pytest -v` the suite.

Each test is parameterized over `["vz", "fc"]` and skips cleanly when its
target backend isn't reachable from this host. The session-scoped server
fixtures probe once per pytest run; un-reachable backends skip *only* the
tests they would have run, not the whole session.

## Requirements per backend

### VZ (Apple Silicon mac)

- A running shed-server reachable as `shed -s my-server list`
  (e.g. via `brew services start shed`).
- Server log at `/opt/homebrew/var/log/shed-server.log` (the homebrew
  default). Override the entry name with `SHED_VZ_SERVER`.

### Firecracker (default: `mini3` over SSH)

- SSH access to the host (passwordless or agent-cached). Override the
  hostname with `SHED_FC_HOST`.
- `shed -s mini3 list` succeeds (i.e. the entry exists in your
  `~/.shed/config.yaml` and the remote server responds).
- Passwordless `sudo -n journalctl -u shed-server` on the remote, for
  the PhaseTimer log-line fetch in tests 2 and 4. Without it, those two
  tests skip cleanly with a clear reason.
- The remote shed-server must be **v0.5.4 or newer** for any
  PhaseTimer-dependent assertion (`test_phase_timer_emitted` and
  `test_plain_create_timing`). Older servers skip those tests.

## Environment overrides

| Variable          | Default       | Effect |
|-------------------|---------------|--------|
| `SHED_VZ_SERVER`  | `my-server`   | Entry name in `~/.shed/config.yaml` for the local VZ server. |
| `SHED_FC_HOST`    | `mini3`       | SSH hostname for the FC server (used for journald log fetch). |
| `SHED_FC_SERVER`  | same as host  | Entry name for the FC server (when it differs from the SSH host). |

## Layout

```
tests/integration/
  pyproject.toml          # uv-managed Python project + pytest config
  uv.lock                 # committed for reproducibility (gitignore exception)
  README.md               # this file
  conftest.py             # vz_server, fc_server, shed_server, test_shed_name
  test_smoke.py           # the MVP five tests
  fixtures/
    __init__.py
    server.py             # LocalServer + RemoteServer + ShedHandle
    timing.py             # PhaseTimer log-line parser
```

## The MVP five tests

| Test                              | What it asserts                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test_create_delete_lifecycle`    | `shed create` succeeds; teardown deletes it cleanly.               |
| `test_phase_timer_emitted`        | Server log contains a `timing: create` line with the expected keys.|
| `test_repo_clone_https`           | `--repo <https url>` + `git log` round-trip in the guest works.    |
| `test_plain_create_timing`        | `agent` phase p50 (5 samples) stays under a per-backend ceiling.   |
| `test_shed_exec_smoke`            | `shed exec name -- echo hello` returns `hello`.                    |

## Per-backend timing ceilings

Defined in `fixtures/server.py:DEFAULT_AGENT_P50_MS`. Generous enough to
tolerate noise; tight enough to catch >200 ms regressions. Tighten over
time as §15 Phase 1 and Phase 2 land.

Today (post v0.5.6):

| Backend | `agent` p50 ceiling |
|---------|---------------------|
| `vz`    | 2200 ms             |
| `fc`    | 2100 ms             |

## Adding a test

```python
def test_my_thing(shed_server, test_shed_name):
    shed_server.create(test_shed_name, image="base")
    r = shed_server.exec(test_shed_name, ["uname", "-r"])
    assert r.returncode == 0
    assert "Linux" in r.stdout or "linux" in r.stdout
```

For a backend-specific test, mark it explicitly:

```python
@pytest.mark.fc
def test_only_on_fc(fc_server, ...):
    ...
```

(Markers are declared in `pyproject.toml` under
`[tool.pytest.ini_options].markers` — keep them in sync.)

## What this suite is *not*

- Not a replacement for the Go unit tests (`make test`) — those run on
  every PR's GHA CI; this suite needs a real VM and runs locally or on
  the bare-metal release-validation host.
- Not the structural unit-ordering tests from PR #127 — those live in
  `internal/vmutil/guest_unit_ordering_test.go` and run on every PR.
  This suite is **additive** to them.
- Not (yet) wired into CI. The MVP runs locally. Hooking into the
  bare-metal half of the `Smoke (Linux)` workflow is a follow-up.
